# Stateful-Object
This is the file containing assignment of Session-3-Day-3 Asssignment related to showing the working of stateful object.

Create a program to illustrate the working of a vehicle(bike, car, truck) where the vehicle would have a fuel capacity. Create 2 methods - one which would move the vehicle and reduce the fuel from it, another one which would fill the fuel into the vehicle. Show how would the vehicle go on to a journey. Use stateful object for the vehicle to hold the current fuel value.
Considerations -

    The fuel capacity of the vehicle is 50 ltrs
    Moving the vehicle once reduces 20 ltrs
    You have to move the vehicle 3 times

Hint - We can move the vehicle 2 times and refuel the vehicle and move the vehicle again.
